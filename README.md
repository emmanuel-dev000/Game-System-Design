# GAME SYSTEM DESIGN

### UI
UI is a prefab inside its own scene.
UI is edited in inspector.
UI is loaded as scene additive.
UI is unloaded as scene after showing its hiding animation.
UI is MonoBehaviour.

For example:
UI Menu is inside UI Menu Scene.

### SCRIPTABLE OBJECTS DATA
MonoBehaviour serialized fields will be put here.
ScriptableObjectsData will use an Editor plugin from GitHub.

For example:
PlayerController(the MonoBehaviour) uses PlayerControllerData (the ScriptableObject).

### VCONTAINER
Game will use the VContainer.
All scripts will follow VContainer â€“ Dependency Inversion.
Game will use the Constructor Injection, and nothing else.
